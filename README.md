## TRAILR: Open hiking platform 
Trailr is a CRUD app build with Ruby that allows people who are feeling isolated or lonely to browse popular walking trails and join as pairs to the posted 'open-hikes' or (when restrictions are lifted from COVID) as groups of 5, 10, 15 to go walking/ hiking together. 

#### Technologies used 
- Ruby 
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Google Maps API
- HTML/ CSS 

# Application Features 

Using the app you will notice that you can create, read, update and delete posts as as mentioned it is a basic CRUD app. As development progresses I would ideally like to have features where the user can have a profile and update the details on their profile so that other people can see their public details. Features that are in the development pipeline can be see on my trello board.

#### Hidden Features 

- Login screen hovering over the logo activates something?
