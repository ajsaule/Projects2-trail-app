# TRAILR: Open hiking platform 
Trailr is a CRUD app build with Ruby that allows people who are feeling isolated or lonely to browse popular walking trails and join as pairs to the posted 'open-hikes' or (when restrictions are lifted from COVID19) as groups of 5, 10, 15 to go walking/ hiking together. 

#### Technologies used 
- Ruby/ Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Google Maps Embed API
- BCrypt [password hashing](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby)
- HTML/ CSS 

# Application Features 

Using the app you will notice that you can create, read, update and delete posts as as mentioned it is a basic CRUD app. As development progresses I would ideally like to have features where the user can have a profile page and have all their favorite trails stored there along with the open-hike events and the date they will be attending them (Notifications and reminders included).
